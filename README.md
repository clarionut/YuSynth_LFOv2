# YuSynth_LFOv2

My modifications to the YuSynth LFO version #2 (http://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/LFO/VC-LFO2.html).

Alterations include
- changes to some component values to reduce current draw
- an increase in the pulse width range to allow very short (or long) pulses
- a fix for glitches in the pulse wave output at low (< 1-2Hz) frequencies
- a modification of the fix by Gabbagabi (https://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=69587) for problems adjusting the triangle and sine wave symmetry at both high and low frequency settings
